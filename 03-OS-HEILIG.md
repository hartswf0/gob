<section name="NON_OBVIOUS_INSIGHTS">
<item>The biological body, not the hardware, was the ultimate point of failure. Heilig attempted to "program" the human nervous system through brute mechanical force. His failures—tinnitus from extreme stereo panning, nausea from millimeter lens slippage, back pain from industrial vibration motors—reveal that the human sensory apparatus aggressively rejects open-loop, unmediated simulation. The medium wasn't just technically limited; it was biologically incompatible.</item>
<item>Capital dictates the architecture of immersion. The trajectory of Heilig's vision—from a collective, 200-seat hemispherical theater (the Ford pitch) down to an isolated, coin-operated arcade box, and finally to a desperate point-of-sale advertising gimmick (the Coca-Cola film)—demonstrates that the individualized, single-user paradigm of virtual reality was not an inherent technological necessity, but a structural byproduct of corporate funding rejection and personal debt.</item>
<item>The pursuit of sensory "realism" demands severe synthetic caricature. To convince the brain it was experiencing reality, Heilig had to aggressively synthesize and reduce it. The "smell of Brooklyn" became a volatile mix of oregano and butyric acid; a woman's presence became industrial synthetic jasmine. Perfect immersion relied on the creation of an easily processed sensory stereotype rather than an authentic physical recreation.</item>
<item>Early virtual reality was an inherently entropic, self-consuming medium. Unlike the supposed permanence of the digital "World Model" that succeeded it, Heilig's "World Building" analog lineage was physically dying from its inception. The celluloid eats itself via vinegar syndrome, the chemical tracks separate, and the rubber dry-rots. The medium's hardware and software were trapped in the same biological decay as the humans it sought to simulate.</item>

<section name="TENSIONS_CONTRADICTIONS">
<item>The paradox of immersive isolation: Heilig envisioned a medium that would fully connect a human to a curated reality, yet the physical mechanisms required to achieve this (the heavy Telesphere mask, the enclosing Sensorama hood) demanded total physical isolation and sensory deprivation from the actual, immediate community.</item>
<item>The contradiction of archival preservation: To save the Sensorama as a historical artifact requires killing it as an experience machine. Museums must paralyze the motors to prevent fire hazards and leave the celluloid warped to preserve the physical truth of the medium. Preservation demands the complete cessation of its defining function.</item>
<item>Narrative empathy vs. mechanical assault: The Sensorama was theoretically designed to place the user seamlessly into another's perspective, yet its operational reality was fundamentally dictatorial. It was a closed loop that violently forced stimuli (blinding lights, loud noises, jarring vibrations) onto a captive user, functioning more as a mechanical assault than a shared narrative experience.</item>

<section name="SO_WHAT">
<field name="Core_Implication">Somatic grounding (tactile and atmospheric feedback) creates faster, deeper cognitive buy-in than high-fidelity visual rendering, but only if it respects the user's vestibular limits.</field>
<field name="Why_It_Matters">Modern immersive design wastes massive capital chasing 1:1 photorealistic digital environments while ignoring the localized, physical friction Heilig mapped. By understanding that a simple fan blowing on the face effectively hacks the brain to cure vection (motion sickness), developers can achieve deeper presence through cheap, synchronized environmental cues rather than infinitely scaling computational power. Heilig proved that the brain forgives visual abstraction if the skin and nose confirm the environment.</field>

<section name="WHATS_MISSING">
<field name="Missing_Question">Beyond the physical complaints logged by arcade operators, what was the actual psychological impact and retention rate of the 1962 working-class patrons? Did they actually achieve "presence," or did they strictly consume it as a mechanical novelty?</field>
<field name="Critical_Assumption">The historical narrative protects the assumption that Sutherland's computational "World Model" and Heilig's analog "World Building" were mutually exclusive evolutionary paths, rather than a false dichotomy that modern mixed reality must eventually synthesize.</field>
<field name="Next_Inquiry">An analysis of Heilig's unproduced scripts (Notebooks 3 & 5) against modern neurobiological models of sensory overload, to determine the exact threshold where mechanical "thick description" breaks cognitive immersion and induces physical rejection.</field>
