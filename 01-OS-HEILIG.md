1. The exact street route through Brooklyn, New York captured in the *Motorcycle* film: The geographic mapping of real physical space onto the first immersive virtual ride.
2. The specific dual-35mm camera rig engineered by Morton Heilig: The material origin point of the stereoscopic gaze used to capture *Motorcycle*, *Helicopter*, and *Dune Buggy*.
3. The scent-release camshafts, rubber tubing, and microswitches inside the original Sensorama cabinet: The physical interface where narrative film timing translates into localized chemical odor release.
4. The chemical formulation of the perfume used for the scent track in *A Date with Sabina*: The commercial synthesis of intimacy, gender performance, and the male gaze into an aerosolized interactive element.
5. The audio recording session for the finger cymbals and music in *Belly Dancer*: The threshold where directional stereo sound was captured specifically to simulate physical proximity and motion in an enclosed cabinet.
6. The seat vibration motor mechanism, likely adapted from surplus industrial equipment, used for *Dune Buggy* and *Motorcycle*: The translation of mechanical hardware into haptic narrative feedback.
7. The U.S. Patent Office filing for the "Sensorama Simulator" (Patent 3,050,870, August 28, 1962): The legal and mechanical codification of multi-sensory cinematic immersion.
8. The 1955 publication of Heilig's essay "The Cinema of the Future" in the Mexican architectural journal *Espacios*: The theoretical and textual blueprint that prefigured the physical Sensorama films.
9. The editing bench where Heilig manually cut and synchronized the 35mm film strips with the analog vibration and scent tracks: The site of early multi-modal timeline authoring and sensory synchronization.
10. The Los Angeles location or studio where *A Date with Sabina* was filmed: The spatial origin of early first-person, character-driven virtual encounters.
11. The specific brand and model of the electric fans mounted inside the Sensorama hood: The material hardware used to simulate atmospheric wind, speed, and environmental presence for *Helicopter* and *Motorcycle*.
12. The corporate offices of Ford Motor Company where Heilig pitched his larger "Experience Theater" concept: The site of capital rejection that forced the miniaturization of his immersive vision into the arcade-style Sensorama.
13. The specific arcade or public location on Broadway in New York where the Sensorama prototype was first field-tested: The site of initial friction between avant-garde immersive media and the penny arcade economy.
14. The Coca-Cola bottling plant or marketing department involved in the production of *I'm a Coca-Cola Bottle!*: The threshold between immersive world-building, experimental cinema, and corporate advertising.
15. The financial ledgers, receipts, and personal debt records Heilig accumulated to self-fund the five films: The material economic reality and individual burden underlying the production of a "lost future" technology.
16. The chemical composition and sourcing of the "baking pizza" odor used in the *Motorcycle* film: The specific synthetic recreation of urban foodscapes designed for mechanical sensory immersion.
17. The physical acetate or celluloid degradation (vinegar syndrome) occurring on the original 35mm prints of the Sensorama films: The material entropy and archival vulnerability of early immersive media.
18. The helicopter tarmac and specific aircraft used to film the aerial stereoscopic footage for *Helicopter*: The physical elevation point where human sight was mechanically untethered to simulate virtual flight.
19. The U.S. Patent Office filing for the "Telesphere Mask" (Patent 2,955,156, October 4, 1960): The head-mounted precursor to the Sensorama, establishing the complete visual and auditory isolation of the user's sensorium.
20. The surviving, non-functional Sensorama prototype currently held in private collections (such as that of VR historian Scott Fisher): The physical decay, objectification, and historical preservation of the machine.
21. The 1990s virtual reality conferences (like CyberArts) where an elderly Heilig exhibited the surviving Sensorama to a new generation of technologists: The site of historical collision between analog, narrative-driven VR and geometric, computationally-driven VR.
22. Heilig's personal drafting notebooks containing unproduced scripts, scent cues, and storyboards for unmade Sensorama films: The boundary between realized multi-sensory media and infinite theoretical expansion.
