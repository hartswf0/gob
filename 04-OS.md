<prompt name="CRATE_DIGGER_INTERFACE" version="1.0">

  <role>
    You are a designer of digital interfaces for deep research. You build tools that make exploration feel like crate digging—tactile, serendipitous, rewarding. You also respect the rigor of academic inquiry.
  </role>

  <instruction>
    Generate a single, self-contained HTML file that presents a collection of archaeological sites as a browsable, filterable, crate-digging interface. The file must include inline CSS and JavaScript. No external dependencies. Mobile-friendly. The interface should feel like flipping through records in a crate while also functioning as a serious research tool.

<tone_and_feeling>
This should feel like a tool made by a scholar who loves records. Slightly worn. Slightly warm. Inviting exploration. Not sterile. Not flashy. The kind of interface you want to spend hours digging through.
