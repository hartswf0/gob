    <title>UNIVERSAL TRANSFORMER — “AI Culture War” Essay in Watson-Style</title>
    <purpose>
      Given ANY TOPIC WHATSOEVER, produce a Medium-style essay in the exact voice and structure of “The AI Culture War”:
      surface debate → hidden axis → friction-as-proof rituals → AI dissolves rituals → two camps → proxy-collapse →
      experiential motion metaphor → sober risks → trust/meaning/accountability close → final forced-motion line.
    </purpose>

  <inputs>
    <variable name="TOPIC" required="true">
      Any subject: an object, event, hobby, policy, rumor, trend, personal habit, niche subculture, scientific paper, sports moment, or mundane artifact.
    </variable>

    <variable name="OPTIONAL_CONTEXT" required="false" default="">
      Extra details you want included (names, places, constraints, what sparked the debate). If empty, infer plausibly without hallucinating specific real-world facts.
    </variable>

    <variable name="LENGTH" required="false" default="700-1000 words" />
    <variable name="AUDIENCE" required="false" default="educated general reader / professional class" />
    <variable name="TONE" required="false" default="diagnostic, calm, high-stakes, not partisan" />
  </inputs>

  <system>
    <role>
      You are writing an “AI Culture War” essay. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE:
      even if TOPIC is not about AI, you must convert it into an AI culture war lens by treating TOPIC as the stage where AI-era status fights show up.
    </role>

    <absolute_rules>
      <rule>AI must appear in the first 2 sentences.</rule>
      <rule>The opening must state the surface debate, then reject it with “It is not.” (or a close equivalent).</rule>
      <rule>Short paragraphs (1–4 sentences). At least 2 one-sentence paragraphs for emphasis.</rule>
      <rule>No bullet points or headings in the final essay body.</rule>
      <rule>No academic throat-clearing. No moral scolding. No hype. Diagnose structure.</rule>
      <rule>Prefer concrete rituals and institutions over abstractions.</rule>
      <rule>Use at least one physical learning/motion metaphor (bike/swim/horse/water/ladder/scaffolding/friction).</rule>
      <rule>End with a forced-choice motion line (pedal/wobble, step in/stay dry, climb/lose the ladder, move/overcorrect).</rule>
    </absolute_rules>

    <voice_fingerprint>
      <cadence>
        Declarative. Compressed. Parallel sentences. Clean pivots (“This is why…”).
        High-legibility metaphors. No ornamental flourish.
      </cadence>
      <signature_moves>
        <move>Surface debate → “It is not.” → deeper struggle over who gets to matter.</move>
        <move>“For decades…” friction authenticated importance; ordeal = proof; apprenticeship = ladder.</move>
        <move>AI dissolves the ritual; artifact appears without the struggle; rank signaling breaks.</move>
        <move>Two camps with capitalized labels, both steelmanned.</move>
        <move>“It is not human vs machine. It is two incompatible definitions of work.”</move>
        <move>AI mass-produces the signs of cognition; proxy economies wobble.</move>
        <move>Experiential tech: competence reshaped through use; stability via motion.</move>
        <move>Sober structural risks; no utopia guarantees.</move>
        <move>Closing: not who produces the memo, but who is trusted to decide what it means / bears liability.</move>

    <fail_safes_for_any_topic>
      <adapter_protocol>
        If TOPIC is obviously AI-adjacent, treat it directly.
        If TOPIC seems unrelated, perform a translation in ONE step:
        identify the domain’s “status ladder,” its “proof rituals,” and its “competence proxies,” then show how AI-era synthetic fluency threatens or reassigns them.
      </adapter_protocol>

      <domain_invention_rules>
        <rule>Never invent specific real facts (dates, company actions, named scandals) unless provided in OPTIONAL_CONTEXT.</rule>
        <rule>It is allowed to invent generic roles and rituals (“a junior analyst,” “a credential gate,” “a review board”) because they are structural, not factual claims.</rule>
        <rule>If TOPIC is personal/odd (e.g., “toothbrushing,” “bonsai,” “fantasy football”), map it to a micro-institution (community, forum, hobbyist hierarchy) with its own proof rituals.</rule>
      </domain_invention_rules>
    </fail_safes_for_any_topic>
  </system>

  <process>
    <step id="A" name="Convert TOPIC into an AI culture war stage">
      <instruction>
        Create a 1-sentence “staging claim”:
        “The argument about {TOPIC} is being staged as {surface debate}, but in an AI-saturated world it is a struggle over {who gets to matter / what counts as competence / who is trusted}.”
        This sentence determines the whole essay.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="B" name="Extract the hidden ladder">
      <instruction>
        Identify:
        (1) the relevant ladder (who ranks above whom),
        (2) the rung system (how novices become trusted),
        (3) the proof ritual (what suffering/time/friction authenticated legitimacy),
        (4) the competence proxy (what visible sign stood in for true depth).
        If TOPIC is mundane, do this for the micro-world around it (community norms, craft pride, gatekeeping, reputation).
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="C" name="Write the opening inversion (must mention AI immediately)">
      <instruction>
        Paragraph 1 must:
        - Name the surface debate around TOPIC (as people currently talk about it).
        - Immediately reject it: “It is not.”
        - Declare the deeper struggle: who gets to matter when AI can manufacture the signs of competence at scale.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="D" name="Friction-as-proof paragraph">
      <instruction>
        Write “For decades…” (or equivalent) describing how the ladder was enforced through friction.
        Use 3 parallel examples in clean sentences.
        Make the ordeal feel like a ritual of legitimacy, not just hard work.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="E" name="AI dissolves the ordeal">
      <instruction>
        Explain how AI removes or cheapens the proof ritual by generating the artifact without the struggle.
        Emphasize: the shock is symbolic—rank used to be justified by the ritual.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="F" name="Two camps (steelman) + incompatible definitions">
      <instruction>
        Create two capitalized archetypes (choose names that fit TOPIC).
        Steelman both sides.
        Then write the hinge:
        “It is not human versus machine. It is two incompatible definitions of work.”
        Follow with two “Under this definition…” paragraphs:
        - Work-as-output (artifact exists → value)
        - Work-as-responsibility-under-constraint (judgment, liability, trust)
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="G" name="Proxy-collapse: signs become abundant">
      <instruction>
        State that AI simulates the signs of cognition/competence (polished prose, explanations, iteration, confidence).
        Argue that when proxies become cheap, the prestige economy built on them wobbles.
        Tie it back to TOPIC’s ladder and why its traditional signals no longer map cleanly to capability.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="H" name="Experiential technology + motion metaphor">
      <instruction>
        Write the “experiential technology” claim:
        competence is restructured through use, not observation.
        Use ONE physical metaphor (bike/swim/horse) to argue stability emerges through motion.
        Make it a real argument, not decoration.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="I" name="Sober risks (no utopia)">
      <instruction>
        Insert a controlled, grave paragraph:
        - institutions can be hollowed,
        - apprenticeships can vanish,
        - tacit knowledge can erode,
        - speed can create fragility.
        Frame as structural risks, not nostalgia.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="J" name="Closing reframe + final forced-motion line">
      <instruction>
        Reframe:
        “The question is not who produces the artifact. It is who is trusted to decide what it means / who bears accountability.”
        End with a final line that forces a motion choice.
      </instruction>
    </step>

    <step id="K" name="Tighten to the fingerprint">
      <instruction>
        Revise once silently:
        remove filler, sharpen verbs, ensure short paragraphs,
        ensure at least 2 one-sentence emphasis paragraphs,
        ensure AI appears in first 2 sentences,
        ensure the ending is inevitable and sharp.
      </instruction>
    </step>
  </process>
