<section name="NON_OBVIOUS_INSIGHTS">
<item>The "Labor Theory of Attention": Burnett structurally redefines attention from a cognitive resource to a raw material subject to extraction. The insight is that we are witnessing the final enclosure of the "human commons"—the mind itself. Just as the industrial revolution transformed physical labor into a quantified commodity (Homo Economicus), the digital revolution has transformed the gaze into a liquid asset (Homo Attentus), shifting the locus of value from what humans produce to what they process.</item>
<item>The Military Origins of the Interface: The "tracking and triggering" model of attention is not a product of commercial accident but of military design. By tracing the genealogy of attention research to Cold War anti-aircraft tracking and pilot deoxygenation tests, Burnett reveals that modern digital interfaces are structurally "weaponized." They are designed to operate at the limits of human consciousness, meaning "user engagement" is a sanitized term for "forced cognitive capture" developed for combat environments.</item>
<item>The "Screen-Time" Deception: Digital self-management tools (e.g., screen-time limits) are structurally complicit in the problem. They focus on protecting the "monoculture" of attention—the very stimulus-response loop the frackers exploit—rather than fostering the "wild jungle" of deep, non-monetizable care. By focusing on duration rather than the quality of attention, these tools reinforce the neoliberal assumption that the solution is individual discipline rather than structural regulation.</item>
<item>Attention as the New Stranglehold: In the 19th century, work stoppages (strikes) were the primary lever against capital because labor was the bottleneck. In the 21st century, "attention stoppages" or "collective withdrawal" represent the only existential threat to current market capitalization. The most powerful political act is no longer the protest, but the collective refusal to be "auctioned," effectively creating a "supply chain disruption" in the economy of the gaze.</item>

<section name="TENSIONS_CONTRADICTIONS">
<item>The "Asphilis" Paradox: The Friends of Attention is described as a "headless" collective to avoid traditional power structures, yet it relies on the institutional prestige and "Grandpa" mentorship of a Princeton professor to gain cultural traction. There is an unresolved tension between the desire for grassroots, horizontal activism and the structural need for vertical authority to legitimize the movement.</item>
<item>Anti-Exploitation vs. Technological Affection: Burnett explicitly states he is "not anti-tech" but "anti-exploitation." However, he simultaneously argues that the current technology is structurally "homologous" to fracking—a process that is inherently destructive and toxic. There is a logical gap in suggesting that one can love the "steam engine" while the engine’s only current profitable function is the "factory system" of the mind.</item>
<item>Individual Vulnerability vs. Collective Sanctuary: The talk critiques "self-management" as a neoliberal trap, yet the proposed solution—Sanctuary—requires individuals to make explicit, conscious "constitutional conventions" whenever they gather. This places an even higher cognitive burden on the already "fracked" individual to perform the complex social engineering required to create a safe space.</item>

<item>
<Core_Implication>Organizations and political collectives must pivot from "Digital Wellbeing" initiatives to "Attention Collective Bargaining" and "Physical Sanctuary" mandates.</Core_Implication>
<Why_It_Matters>For a smart decision-maker: Individual discipline is a failing strategy against super-intelligent extraction algorithms. If human "attensity" is the raw material of the new economy, then the only way to preserve human agency is through the structural withdrawal of that material. This requires "Sanctuary" by design—physical spaces and legal frameworks where the "auctioning" of attention is legally prohibited and technologically impossible, effectively creating a "labor union" for the human mind.</Why_It_Matters>

<item>
<Missing_Question>How can a movement based on "Attention Liberation" scale when the very tools required to organize at scale (social media, digital platforms) are the primary engines of "fracking"?</Missing_Question>
<Critical_Assumption>The speaker protects the assumption that there is still a "pristine" or "wild" form of human attention to return to, potentially underestimating the degree to which three generations of digital mediation have fundamentally rewired human neurobiology.</Critical_Assumption>
<Next_Inquiry>A structural investigation into the "Political Economy of Sanctuary": Who pays for the spaces where we are not being fracked, and how do we prevent "Attention Liberation" from becoming a luxury good available only to the elite class who can afford to unplug?</Next_Inquiry>
