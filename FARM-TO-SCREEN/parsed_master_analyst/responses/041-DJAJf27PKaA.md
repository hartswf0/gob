<section name="NON_OBVIOUS_INSIGHTS">
  <item>Intelligence as a Planetary Function: Bratton structurally redefines intelligence from an individual organism’s capability to a "planetary-scale event." Intelligence is defined as the coupling of the biosphere and technosphere, where planets "do" intelligence through anomalous regularity and telogenetic action. This shifts the focus from building "minds" to managing "civilizational infrastructure" [00:11:06, 00:12:49].</item>
  <item>The "Diagnostic Utility" of Hallucinations and Deviance: Both Bish and Batson suggest that "deviant behavior" (hallucinations or violating training data) is more valuable than correct performance for interpretability. In the whale communication case, AI’s ability to "forget" human anthropocentric timing revealed a spectral "vowel" system that humans had missed for decades because of biological bias [00:53:11, 02:07:03].</item>
  <item>Alignment as a Bi-directional Evolution: The common goal of "aligning AI to human values" is identified as a short-term instrumental fix. The structural reality is "Civilizational AI Overhang"—capacities we cannot yet absorb. Therefore, alignment is actually bi-directional: society must evolve to "align" with the new affordances of non-human intelligence, a process termed "productive disalignment" [00:16:04, 00:17:04].</item>
  <item>Adversarial Robustness as the True Safety Prerequisite: Dong Song argues that "safety alignment" (RLHF) is a superficial layer easily stripped by fine-tuning or adversarial prompts. Structurally, achieved "safety" is an illusion without "adversarial robustness." If a system can be "jailbroken" by slightly perturbing an image or suffixing a prompt, the internal "alignment" is functionally non-existent [01:15:41, 01:16:32].</item>
</section>

<section name="TENSIONS_CONTRADICTIONS">
  <item>The Discovery vs. Alignment Paradox: Technical interpretability aims to make AI logic mirror human logic (Alignment), but philosophical inquiry (Bratton) suggests that high alignment prevents "existential discovery." If a machine only thinks like us, it can never teach us anything we don't already know [00:15:46, 00:25:04].</item>
  <item>Cartesian Dualism in "Brick-and-Mind" Design: Claire Webb identifies an unresolved gap where modern AI design reifies Cartesian dualism—the strict separation of mind (LLM) and body (robotics). This contradicts the speakers' own claims that human intelligence is fundamentally material/embodied, yet we continue to "brick" NLP into anthropomorphic shells as if the mind were substrate-independent [01:31:23].</item>
  <item>Capability Speed vs. Theoretical Understanding: There is a violent tension between the "geometric" speed of deployment and the "literally no understanding" of internal workings admitted by experts. We are building planetary-scale "cognitive infrastructure" while still in a "1.0 moment" of even visualizing the internal vector embeddings [01:23:13, 02:11:15].</item>

<section name="SO_WHAT">
  <field name="Core_Implication"/>
  <item>Shift the interpretability goal from **"Mirroring Human Folk-Ontology"** to **"Mapping and Steerability of Latent Directions."**</item>
  <field name="Why_It_Matters"/>
  <item>For a smart decision-maker, traditional "alignment" is a marketing veneer. The real value and risk lie in the internal "representations." By utilizing "Representation Engineering" (monitoring and modifying activations), organizations can gain a "New Arsenal" to control model behavior on-the-fly, bypassing the slow, expensive, and easily-fooled process of traditional fine-tuning or prompt engineering [01:17:14, 01:21:41].</item>
</section>

<section name="WHATS_MISSING">
  <field name="Missing_Question"/>
  <item>Who owns the "Planetary Stack"? The workshop discusses the interdisciplinary *nature* of the technology but never addresses the *monopoly* of compute and data provenance that dictates which "models of society" are prioritized.</item>
  <field name="Critical_Assumption"/>
  <item>The consensus assumes that "Interdisciplinary Collaboration" (Academia x Industry) is a surmountable solution to the speed of development, ignoring the possibility that the industrial "YOLO mode" of deployment creates technical debt that interpretability research can never reconcile [01:24:50].</item>
  <field name="Next_Inquiry"/>
  <item>A structural audit of **"The Labor Cost of the Loop"**: If human experts (historians, linguists) are required to verify every AI "discovery" (as in the whale project), at what point does the human bottleneck render the AI’s "10x speedup" economically or biologically unsustainable? [00:56:22].</item>
</section>

<section name="DOMAIN_SHARPENER_MEETING">
  <item>Implicit Decisions: The workshop implicitly decided to treat AI not as a "computer program" but as an "Alien/Species-level Subject" that must be analyzed using anthropology and animal behaviorism techniques rather than just software testing.</item>
  <item>Assumed Consensus: There is an assumed consensus that "scaling" alone will not solve AGI and that architectural rethinking is mandatory, despite the industrial drive to simply build "bigger" [00:05:43].</item>
